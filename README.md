# **How We Assess Mathematics Degrees: Post Covid-19 Era**

## **Overview**
This project explores the impact of **Covid-19** on assessment methods used in **mathematics degrees** across UK universities. By replicating previous studies, the report analyzes **pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic** assessment strategies to identify trends and transformations in the summative assessment diet.

## **Key Findings**
- **Examinations remain dominant** but **open-book exams** have increased significantly post-Covid.
- The pandemic **accelerated the use of online assessments** and **alternative evaluation methods**.
- **University ranking influences assessment methods**—higher-ranked institutions rely more on closed-book exams.
- The **University of Edinburgh case study** revealed a statistically significant shift in assessment methods **before and after Covid-19**.
- A **regional comparison (England vs Scotland)** suggests slight variations in assessment distribution.
- **Mathematics assessment is evolving**, with increasing adoption of **e-assessment tools and project-based evaluations**.

## **Methodology**
- **Data collected** from publicly available university sources.
- Analysis includes:
  - **Correlation & Regression** to identify trends.
  - **Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U, ANOVA, t-tests)** to assess significant differences.
  - **Principal Component & Cluster Analysis** to categorize assessment methods.

## **Assessment Trends (2019 vs 2023)**
| **Assessment Type** | **Pre-Pandemic (2019)** | **Post-Pandemic (2023)** | **Change** |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Closed-Book Exams (CBEs) | **70.06%** | **55.54%** | ↓  |
| Open-Book Exams (OBEs) | **0.05%** | **9.97%** | ↑  |
| Written Hand-ins | **1.67%** | **3.37%** | ↑  |
| Class Tests | **3.57%** | **2.42%** | ↓  |
| Project-Based Assessments | **Stable** | **Stable** | - |

## **Conclusion**
Mathematics assessment practices have **undergone significant changes** due to the pandemic. While **traditional examinations persist**, alternative methods like **open-book exams, online assessments, and coursework-based evaluation** are gaining traction.
